Built using a DIYMORE Pro-Mini (Leonardo Mini clone).
Servos can be connected to pins 9, 8, 7, 6 (7 and 6 are reversed).
Buttons are connected to pins 4, 3, 2 for controling the servo tester.

The servo tester cycles between middle (1500), min (1100) & max (1900) on the press of button 1.
Buttons 2 and 3 move the trim up and down in 10 increments.
Pressing buttons 2 and 3 together resets the trim to 0 (1500).
Holding button 1 for 1 second flashes out the current trim in 10s on the leds.
